# Disclaimer
THIS IS NOT A OFFICIAL APACHE BEAM EXAMPLE OR TUTORIAL.

I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH APACHE BEAM IN ANY MANNER.

# Introduction
Example app using Apache Beam and imdb datasets that I wrote as a way to learn more about Apache Beam.

My goal was writing a example app that, based on an Principal Name input, would search for titles related with that principal, and output those.

Do I need to use Beam for this? No, but I needed something to write and seamed a good example.

## Technical Details
- Java 11 (writen and tested with openjdk on Arch Linux)
- Maven
- No dependencies other than Beam and logging

## TODO
- [ ] Configuration for datasets location
- [ ] Configuration for Principal Name Input
- [ ] Pretty print output
- [ ] Custom windows
- [ ] Execution with Apache Flink
- [ ] Documentation on how to execute with GCP Dataflow
- [ ] General documentation on the example
